### I am in the job market. If you are interested in my work, shoot my an email!

My name is George (In Greek: Yorgos) Argyros, and I am a recent PhD graduate from Columbia University.


The artistic depiction of myself in the picture, was quickly done by my friend and talented painter [Yannis Selimiotis](https://www.instagram.com/yiannis.selimiotis/).
