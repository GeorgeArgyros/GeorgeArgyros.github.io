My name is George (Yorgos) Argyros, and I am a recent PhD graduate from Columbia University. I am generally interested in program analysis and verification, machine learning, security, cryptography and any combination of these  fields.

In the distant past I used to do a lot of applied security such as penetration testing, source code auditing and exploit development. During my undergraduate studies in the university of Athens I was lucky enough to be advised by Aggelos Kiayias with whom I worked in various cryptography projects and mainly on the fun topic of randomness attacks against PHP applications. These attacks affected a number of popular PHP projects such as Joomla, Wikipedia and overall affected approximately 10% of internet applications.

During my PhD in [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) I was advised by professors Angelos Keromytis and Tal Malkin. My work revolved mostly around program analysis and bug finding techniques ranging from symbolic execution 
for interpreted languages to learning-based methods for testing, with a short interlude of attacking location-based services.
Our location attacks affected a number of popular services such as Facebook, Tinder, Foursquare and resulted in a bug-bounty
award from Facebook. Our bug finding techniques resulted in the discovery of over 30 vulnerabilities in security criticial
components such as Web Application Firewalls and SSL/TLS libraries.
