My name is George (In Greek: Yorgos) Argyros, and I am a recent PhD graduate from Columbia University. I am generally interested in program analysis and verification, machine learning, security and cryptography and any combination of these  fields.

In the distant past I used to do a lot of applied security such as penetration testing, source code auditing and exploit development. During my undergraduate studies in university of Athens I was lucky enough to be advised with Aggelos Kiayias with whom I worked in various cryptography projects and mainly on the fun topic of randomness attacks against PHP applications. 
During my PhD I was fortunate to be advised by Angelos Keromytis and Tal Malkin and worked mostly on program analysis and bug finding techniques ranging from symbolic execution 
for interpreted languages to learning-based methods for testing with a short interlude of attacking location-based services.
For more information on my work, take a look at my [projects](/projects/) and [publications](/publications/).

The artistic depiction of myself in the picture, was quickly made by the talented painter [Yannis Selimiotis](https://www.instagram.com/yiannis.selimiotis/).
